# Google Gemini hallucinated two "theorems" in combinatorial tensor theory.
#
# **Hallucinated Inner Horn Uniqueness Theorem**:
# "An inner horn is unique if and only if the tensor has rank at most 2 and 
# its shape is a partition of a number.This theorem was first proven by Thomas Brylawski in 1975. 
# It is a powerful tool in the study of combinatorial tensor theory and has been used to prove many 
# other results in the field." 
# 
# This unmitigated horseshit was followed by an even more egregious claim:
#
# **Hallucinated Hypermatrix Uniqueness Theorem**:
# There is a version of the Inner Horn Uniqueness Theorem that depends on the shape and rank of 
# a multi-dimensional matrix. It was first proven by Ezra Getzler and Jacob Lurie in 2009, and 
# it states as follows: An inner horn of a multi-dimensional matrix is unique if and only if the 
# multi-dimensional matrix has rank at most 2 and its shape is a partition of a number.
# 
# Bard, now Gemini, claimed that [0,1,2]⊗[3,4]⊗[5,6] does not have a unique inner horn.
# This is vacuously true, because it does not have an inner horn at all. This tensor has shape (3,2,2)
# which has simplicial dimension min(shape) - 1 = 1, which means there are no outer horns. 
# 
# Let's check with our code. Gemini produced the following Python code to construct the hypermatrix.
